Certainly! Here's a list of coding questions that can help you practice and enhance your logic-building skills as a frontend developer:

1. **Reverse a String:**
   - Write a function that reverses a given string.

2. **Palindrome Check:**
   - Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

3. **FizzBuzz:**
   - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

4. **Factorial:**
   - Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

5. **Find the Maximum Number:**
   - Write a function to find the maximum number in an array.

6. **Remove Duplicates:**
   - Write a function that removes duplicates from an array.

7. **Count Vowels:**
   - Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

8. **Check for Anagrams:**
   - Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

9. **Implement a Stack or Queue:**
   - Implement a basic stack or queue data structure.

10. **Find the Missing Number:**
    - Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

11. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays:**
    - Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

12. **Rotate an Array:**
    - Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is a non-negative integer.

13. **Binary Search:**
    - Implement the binary search algorithm.

14. **Substring Search:**
    - Write a function to check if a given string is a substring of another string.

15. **Deep Clone an Object:**
    - Write a function to deep clone an object.

16. **Find the Intersection of Two Arrays:**
    - Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

17. **Flatten a Nested Array:**
    - Write a function to flatten a nested array.

18. **Implement a debounce function:**
    - Write a debounce function that delays invoking a function until after a certain amount of time has elapsed since the last time the function was invoked.

19. **Implement a throttle function:**
    - Write a throttle function that ensures that a function is only called at most once in a specified amount of time.

20. **Implement a Carousel:**
    - Create a simple image carousel/slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Remember to focus not just on solving the problems but also on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code. Happy coding!
